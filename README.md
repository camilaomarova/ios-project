# ios-project
This is a final project for iOS course. Please, run it on the phone, simulator does not support CoreMotion.

1. Project Idea:        Bullet Game App(a.k.a стрелялка) "CamSpace"

2. Project Description: This is a game, where you are an UFO in a space and trying to hit all the planets with your 
                        bullets(orange burning spheres) in order to explose them! The more you make explosions - the more you get
                        score! If any planet touches you - you die. You can also choose the difficulty of your game.
                        
3. UML: https://ibb.co/jCVoWR


UI mockup: FluidUI doesn't allow you to add images if you don't have account with money. And any other mockups are not free. I dont have Sketch. That's why I did my mockup in Photoshop.
It was terrible, but here they are:

4. Plan of works

9 week:  To build a design of my app (mockup), UML diagram of whole project, construct architecture, watch some tutorials(done)

10 week: Choose the appropriate techniques like closures/singleton etc. Think and search about what dependencies I will be using
Search for animations, like bullets or throwing bullets in space. Maybe I will use SpriteKit for Swift

11 week: Start with a storyboard, adding main controllers, write a code for main class with game. At this week I should
be able to shoot with bullets by UFO. I will create class for game scene.
I will search for right sounds like explosion, etc. 

12 week: Adding some features, like dying in game, scoring, etc.

13 week: Search for right methods for choosing the difficulty of the game.

14 week: Construct and make the app as a whole project, testing for bugs (if appeared - fix them), making UI prettier

15 week: Defending the project, prepare for defense, make report, have a feedback and improve it later (just kidding, who needs my app)
